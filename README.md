This repository contains the work I did for the  [Cognitive computational neuro science course](https://www.studiegids.science.ru.nl/2015/en/socsci/prospectus/cns/course/36352/)  at radboud university.
The practical folder contains the assignments I did during the course. More interestingly the end-assignment folder contains a little research i did. Where i compare the vulnerability to [adversarial example images](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/07/deep-learning-adversarial-examples-misconceptions.html) of the discriminator of generative adversarial networks to the vulnerability of supervised networks on the MNIST dataset. 

You can find the report [here](https://github.com/svoss/ru-ccn/tree/master/end-assignment/report/report.pdf) and the code [here](https://github.com/svoss/ru-ccn/tree/master/end-assignment/notebooks)
